## Summary

This is the source for opensurf.ai

OpenSurf is the open, privacy-first runtime that lets AI agents safely use the web on behalf of humans. It bridges the gap between local intelligence and the online world â€” giving developers a transparent, auditable layer for automation, browsing, and action. Built for trust and interoperability, OpenSurf turns the web into a programmable, agent-ready surface while keeping users in full control of their data, context, and consent.

The website also has a completely unecessary water simulation on it, because @dpeek is a god-tier procrastinator!

## Running

Run `bun dev` (you might have to setup alchemy? not sure)

Add `?debug` for simulation gui and expose parameters in `params.ts`

Contributions (including sharks) welcome!
